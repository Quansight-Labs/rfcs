You can edit this document as you wish. You can also edit the LaTeX
data in img elements, but only the content of `latex-data`:

  1. To automatically update the LaTeX rendering in img element, edit
     the file while watch_latex_md.py is running.

  2. Never change the beginning (`<img latex-data="...`) and the end
     (`...alt="latex">`) parts of the LaTeX img elements as these are
     used by the watch_latex_md.py script.

  3. Changes to other parts of the LaTeX img elements will be
     overwritten.

Enjoy LaTeXing!

# Literature

Since sparse tensor usage in deep learning is a new topic, in this document
we intend to collect various publications related to sparse tensor/matrix
computational techniques and how they can possibly be used in PyTorch.
